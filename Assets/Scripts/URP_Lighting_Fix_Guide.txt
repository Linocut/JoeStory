// URP Lighting Troubleshooting Guide

/* SOLUTION 1: Check Additional Lights Setting */
1. Go to Project Settings > Graphics
2. Find your URP Asset (Universal Render Pipeline Asset)
3. Click on it in the inspector
4. Under "Lighting" section:
   - Ensure "Additional Lights" is set to "Per Pixel" (not "Disabled")
   - Set "Per Object Limit" to at least 4-8
   - Check "Additional Light Shadows" if you need shadows

/* SOLUTION 2: Check Forward Renderer Data */
1. In your URP Asset, find "Renderer List"
2. Click on the Forward Renderer Data asset
3. In the renderer settings:
   - Ensure "Rendering Path" is set to "Forward" or "Forward+"
   - Check that "Additional Lights" is enabled

/* SOLUTION 3: Light Component Settings */
1. Select your Point/Spot lights
2. In Light component:
   - Set "Render Mode" to "Auto" or "Important"
   - Ensure "Light Layer" is set to "Default" or matches your objects
   - Check that "Range" is sufficient
   - Verify "Intensity" is high enough (try 1-10)

/* SOLUTION 4: Material Settings */
1. Check your materials are URP compatible:
   - Use "Universal Render Pipeline/Lit" shader
   - NOT "Standard" shader (that's Built-in RP only)
   
/* SOLUTION 5: Scene View vs Game View */
1. Check if lights appear in Scene view but not Game view
2. This indicates a camera or rendering settings issue
